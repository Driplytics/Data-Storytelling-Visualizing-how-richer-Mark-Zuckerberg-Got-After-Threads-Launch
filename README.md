You might be wondering about the Threads frenzy and how it impacted Zuck’s net worth after the launch. Here is an Answer!

### In this report, we'll be exploring:
1. What's Zuck's stake in META?
2. Threads pull
3. Meta's Market Cap Influence
Let's get started!

## What's Zuck's stake in META?
![Zuck's Meta stake](https://github.com/Driplytics/Data-Storytelling-Visualizing-how-richer-Mark-Zuckerberg-Got-After-Threads-Launch/blob/main/Mark%20Zuckerberg's%20Threads%20networth/Zuck's%20stake%20in%20meta.png "Zuck's Meta stake")
Let's break down the numbers. In Meta's recent 10-Q filing from July 10th, they reported having a total of 2,573,161,373 outstanding shares. These are split into two categories: Class A shares, which make up 2,222,582,542 shares, and Class B shares, which add up to 350,578,831 shares.
Looking back at an earlier Proxy filing in April '23, we learned that Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's key figure, owns 831,706 Class A shares and a significant 349,745,790 Class B shares, totaling 350,577,496 shares in his name.
When we compare these figures, it becomes clear that Mark Zuckerberg's ownership stake in Meta accounts for around 13.6% of the company. This substantial ownership makes him the largest shareholder in Meta, emphasizing his pivotal role and influence within the company's operations.

## Threads pull
While the rise in Meta's valuation cannot be solely attributed to the Threads launch (as the company's value was already improving before the launch), it's evident that the launch has contributed positively. Following the Threads launch, Meta's valuation surged from $698.33 billion to $734.64 as of the recent Friday's close.
This upward momentum can be attributed to the renewed interest of investors in the technology sector. As of August 27th, '23, Meta's share price stands at $285.50, reflecting this heightened investor confidence in the company.

## Meta's Market Cap Influence
This influence trickles down to Zuck's net worth, considering he's the largest shareholder in Meta.
### How did we calculate Mark Zuckerberg's net worth?
We started by assuming that most of Zuckerberg's wealth is tied to Meta; even though he owns other assets, most of his wealth is there.
This implies that any change in Meta's valuation directly impacts Zuck's net worth.
Based on calculations performed on 27th Aug '23, Zuck's networth would be calculated as:
Market Value of Zuck's Stake = Current Market Capitalization * Ownership Percentage
Market Value of Zuck's Stake= $734.64 * 13.6%
This pegs Zuck's net worth at $100.06 (as of Aug 27th, '23)

Think of Meta's market capitalization as the captain of a financial ship, steering the course that guides Zuck's net worth. So, when Meta's market capitalization sets sail for new horizons, you can bet Zuck's net worth is right there riding the waves of change! That's how big of an influence Meta's market Capitalization has on Zuck's Networth.
